                    <div class="uk-width-large-5-10 uk-width-medium-7-10 uk-width-small-8-10 title">Why People bet on live matches </div>
                    <div class="uk-width-0-12 text" style="color:#737373;"><p style="font-size: 16px;">First, by watching the match on TV or on live-streaming where you have a better imagination for the out-coming result since the more information you have at your disposal, the easier it is to make informed judgements.<br>
                        Second, when you bet live the odds will be much higher. The odds are dynamic and change according to the course of the event.<br>
                        Bookmakers make adjustments to their odds very quickly based on the action they are watching. Most for the time bookmaker do not have the time to put as much thought into these adjustments, so they are not quite as tight as normal. This makes it a little easier for us to be able to find value.<br>
                        And last, with live bet you can win very quick most of the time within few minutes. Our only drawback is that you have to be fast sometimes goals lands few seconds after posting as you know this is inplay/live bet and I cannot control/delay the goals.<br></p>

                    <div class="uk-width-0-12 text" style="color:#737373;"><p style="font-size: 16px;">We recommend 2-4% of your bankroll on each tip EG – If you have a €$500 bankroll betting €10 on every tip will make profit on a monthly basis. You can increase this to 4% (€20) if you want to be more aggressive but you have to be aware your risk of ruin is higher if we go on a bad run. So, for example lets say $10 on each bet &amp divide it into two individual bets, that is, €5 bet at odd 1.80 &amp sometime after if still available €5 repeat the bet at odd 2.3 or you can wait for odds to hit 3 &amp above as long as they do not score early. If you cannot afford to do €10 on each bet, then tailor it to what you can afford. Just make sure that the stake you use is the same for every bet! As simple as that<br>
                            For Goal Line Over bet, follow these rules, if you don’t understand <a href="betting-types.php">Goal Line over read HERE</a> 
                            When over 1 Goal line First Half Goal reaches 2+ then place bet - this helps to cover early goals in the match. Then if still no goal is scored and Over 0.5 First Half Goal reaches 2.0 or 3+ place bet, you are then covered if only 1 goal is scored (the other Goal line will be refunded also) so you will be in profit, sometimes 2 goals can land during the last few minutes therefore both bets will win(Odd 2+ & odd 3.5+). Apply the same rule to other Over Goal line option please

                    <div class="uk-width-0-12 text" style="color:#737373;"><p style="font-size: 16px;">Patience is a virtue. A quote applicable to every aspect of life and very important in betting, successful betting all comes down to you and your actions.<br> 
                        Patience and discipline are the foundations of a winning account. Patience in betting equates to smart gambling which in turn leads to success. None of us want to lose, especially to the bookies.<br>
                        Patience and timing will also help you getting the right price odds at the right time <br>
                        Losing money often leads to an urge to get it back, but those thoughts often lead to reckless and uneducated betting. In situations like these, it is important to remember that not only will there be better betting opportunities coming up, whether it be tomorrow or in two weeks time.

                    <div class="uk-width-0-12 text" style="color:#737373;"><p style="font-size: 16px;">Nobody likes losing to the bookies and it is very important for you to be aware I cannot score for the teams if they fail to do so. It is a fact of life that even the best pro bettors go through losing streaks, but the way they deal with their losses that sets them apart from consistent losers. Losing money often leads to an urge to get it back, but those thoughts often lead to reckless and uneducated betting. This is where bankroll management and staking plan play a vital role. Nice and steady always wins the race<br>
                        When you win most of the time and later lose a few bets you rarely notice the wins, you tend to feel the loses more and this can cause some real confusions and play tricks on your mind unless you understand and think like a successful punter who embrace losing as part of gambling because they are more focused on winning more money over a longer period of time and they know with sports betting that there are endless opportunities ahead.
